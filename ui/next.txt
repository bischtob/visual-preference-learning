1. sequential kmeans
  with some clever exploration heuristic (need to research or come up with myself)

  it's basically doing stochastic gradient descent...right now.
  multiple gradient descent is really similar to kmeans.
  so let's just do kmeans :p


really difficult getting sequential kmeans to work properly.
this is basically exploration/exploitation...
exploration is looking at random things
exploitation is looking at things near where we think clusters are

definitely the multi-cluster approach is best.


for k-means, the 'recommendation' thing needs to be updated...
to not show duplicate pictures
we need some notion of momentum or something, to make the cluster updating better


okay let's try this.
we weight the points by the score
and also have an exploration / exploitation phase

next attempt: cluster-based!
we assume you have one of the clusters
and we score samples from all the clusters


this dumb app is making me feel really crummy.
rating and stuff.
crummy.
