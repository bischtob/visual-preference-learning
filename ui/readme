Replication steps:

1. Copy the image folder 'all' to 'static/data/all'.
   The images need to be in the "static" folder so that the 
   server can actually reference them (if they exist elsewhere 
   on the filesystem, the browser will complain since it's 
   technically a cross-origin request.) 
   
   I didn't commit this to git since it's huge.

2. Consume the 'requirements.txt' file

3. Run 'export FLASK_APP=server.py' (set the FLASK_APP environment variable)

4. Run 'python -m flask run'

5. Point your browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 or wherever addr it tells you.
