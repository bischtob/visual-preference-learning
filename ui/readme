Replication steps:

1. Copy the image folder 'all' to 'static/data/all'.
   The images need to be in the "static" folder so that the 
   server can actually reference them (if they exist elsewhere 
   on the filesystem, the browser will complain since it's 
   technically a cross-origin request.) 
   
   I didn't commit this to git since it's huge.

2. Consume the 'requirements.txt' file

3. Run 'export FLASK_APP=server.py' (set the FLASK_APP environment variable)

4. check that localize_image_path in server.py has the correct image extension, etc.

5. run 'add_images_db.py' (adds image data to the database that server.py uses)

6. Run 'python -m flask run'

7. Point your browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 or wherever addr it tells you.
